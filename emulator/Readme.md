# Emulator

This is a lasertag emulatur using

* a <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12923" target="_blank">Microview</a>
* a KY-040 rotary dialer with button
* one red LED (transmission status)
* one IR-LED (actual transmission)

## Usage
Just turn the key to the desired function then push the button to send the signal

## Technical details

Since the microview is an Arduino at heart it should be possible to use any regular Arduino. Just take out all the "uView"-calls in the code - and add a couple LEDs that show you the position of the cursor ;)

The small packets were generated by hand (2014-12-07). Only for the stats packages I used the ODS file. The validity of these packages have yet to be verified.

## TODO
* Make a proper fritzing diagram
* Create a nice video showing the UI in action
* Add a nice picture
